/**
 * ListCard.jsx
 *
 * One card on the home screen, standing for one list the user owns: the list's
 * name in bold on the left, how much of it is done underneath, and a delete
 * button on the right.
 *
 * WHAT REPLACED HW1's CARD TEMPLATES
 * ----------------------------------
 * In HW1 a home screen card took three pieces to make: a <template> in
 * index.html holding the blank markup, ListCardPrototype to clone that template
 * and pour a list's data into the copy, and CardPrototype above it holding the
 * cloning code both card types shared.
 *
 * A component does all of that in one place. It is markup and data in the same
 * expression, in one file, and there is no clone step, so a card can never be
 * stamped out and then only half filled in.
 *
 * The one rule that survives is the one about user text, and it survives for
 * free: {list.name} below is escaped by React, always. HW1 had to enforce that
 * by hand with textContent and had a test watching for anyone who used innerHTML
 * instead.
