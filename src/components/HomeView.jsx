                    alt is deliberately empty. The logo sits immediately beside the
                    words "Wolfie Lists", so giving it alt text would make a screen
                    reader announce the same thing twice. An empty alt is how you
                    say "this image is decoration", which is different from
                    omitting the attribute entirely.

                    width and height carry the image's real pixel dimensions even
                    though the classes size it. The browser uses them to work out
                    the aspect ratio and reserve the space before the file has
                    loaded, so the title does not jump sideways on a slow
                    connection.
